## Conclusion
This dashboard highlights how compensation, remote work availability, and benefits vary significantly across data roles and regions. It allows quick identification of high-demand roles, salary ranges, and market differences, making it useful for job seekers, analysts, and hiring stakeholders.  
Job postings show a clear seasonal pattern, with a sharp decline in September–November and a low in November. Demand rebounds in December, peaking in January–February, suggesting optimal hiring periods and job-seeking windows.
